      <h2>Reflections / Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        As a passionate CSE student at IIIT Sricity, I aim to bridge the gap
        between technology and real-world problem-solving. My journey started
        with curiosity and evolved into creating impactful digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From building <b>Nutri Connect</b> to exploring AI algorithms, every
        project strengthens my belief in the transformative power of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is <b>hands-on and project-driven</b>. I thrive on building,
        experimenting, and solving challenges in full-stack development, ML, and
        cloud technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I aspire to work at the intersection of AI, cloud, and
        web development to create meaningful impact.
